# Kryvos

This repository contains the software of the publicly tally-hiding
Kryvos e-voting framework.

To get started, build the docs with

```bash
python3 -m sphinx.cmd.build -b html docs/ docs/build/
```

You can now open the docs by opening the file
``docs/build/index.html`` in a browser.
